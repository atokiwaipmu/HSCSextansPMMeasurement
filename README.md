# HSCSextansPMMeasurement

This repository contains the code for the HSC SSP (Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program) paper on the proper motion measurement of the Sextans dwarf galaxy.

## Repository Structure

This repository consists of several Python scripts that perform different tasks:

1. `data/dataprocess.py`: Processes the raw data.
2. `data/galaxycorrection.py`: Performs galaxy correction on the data.
3. `structure/memberselection.py`: Selects members from the data.
4. `structure/structure.py`: Analyzes the structure of the celestial bodies in the data.
5. `structure/halflightrad.py`: Computes the half-light radius for different models.

Each script can be run independently and accepts command line arguments for flexibility.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine and ensure that you have all the necessary Python packages installed.
